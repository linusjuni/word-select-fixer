# Word Select Fixer

A lightweight Chrome extension that removes trailing spaces when you double-click to select words.

## The Problem

By default, Chrome includes the space after a word when you double-click to select it. This is annoying when you want to copy a word without extra whitespace, especially for passwords, code snippets, or precise text selection.

## The Solution

This extension automatically removes trailing spaces from your selection immediately after you double-click a word. The selection becomes cleaner and more precise, matching your actual intent.
